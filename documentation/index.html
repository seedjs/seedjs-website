      <h1>Installing Packages</h1>
      <p>To install a seed package, just use the <code>install</code> command:</p>
      <blockquote><code>$ seed install markdown</code></blockquote>
      <p>This will install both the package itself as well as any dependencies in a shared location on your computer (usually ~/.seeds/packages).</p>
    </section>

      <h1>Requiring Packages</h1>
      <p>seed extends the require() function defined for your module so that it can 
      find seed packages as well as regular node modules. This means to use seed
      you need to make sure it is loaded before you use require. Normally the
      best way to do this is to run your JavaScript using seed. For example,
      to run some JavaScript you could use seed like so:</p>
      <blockquote><code>$ seed ./path/to/my/javascript.js</code></blockquote>

      <p>This will preload seed then run your JavaScript with node.js as normal. You 
      can also invoke your code using seed as a pound-bash:</p>
      <blockquote><code>
        #!/usr/bin/env seed<br />
        var markdown = require('markdown');<br />
        markdown.makeHtml('# Hello World!');<br />
      </code></blockquote>

      <p>Once you are running with seed, you can load package code simply with require:</p>
      <blockquote><code>require('markdown');</code></blockquote>

      <p>This will look for a module in your local package (if you have one) named
      &#8216;markdown&#8217;. If it is not found, seed will look for a package named
      &#8216;markdown&#8217;. If still not found, it will look for a node library by the same
      name.</p>
      <p>Generally this means that code written for node will continue to work with
      seed unchanged.</p>

      <h1>Requiring Modules Within Packages</h1>
      <p>Often times you will only want to work with a package by requiring its 
      public API. You get this API by calling <code>require('packageName')</code>. If you 
      instead need to require an individual module within a package, you and get the
      module by using namespacing. For example:</p>
      <blockquote><code>require('markdown:parser');</code></blockquote>

      <p>Would look for a module named &#8216;parser&#8217; inside the &#8216;markdown&#8217; package.</p>
    </section>

      <h1>Creating Your Own Packages</h1>
      <p>seed is useful if you need to hack out a single JavaScript file to run on the
      command line. But if you plan to build a larger app, you are probably going 
      to want to split your code into multiple files. You may even want to split
      your code into multiple packages that you can share with others.</p>
      <p>In both of these cases, the best way to manage your files is to create 
      a package for yourself.</p>
      <p>Building a package is very easy. Just create a folder, add a package.json 
      file and put your source code into a lib folder like so:</p>
      <pre><code>hello-world/
package.json  &lt;-- contains your package definition
lib/
  index.js  &lt;-- default module
  another-module.js
</code></pre>

      <p>In Seed, the default module is called &#8216;index.js&#8217;. This module usually exports
      your public API. It is loaded when someone requires your package without 
      naming a specific module (for example <code>require('markdown')</code> would look in the
      &#8216;markdown&#8217; package for a module named &#8216;index&#8217;).</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can omit the index.js file and use a file with the same 
      name as the package. In the example above, <code>index.js</code> could be renamed to 
      <code>hello-world.js</code> and it would still load as the default.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Defining Your Package.json</h2>
        <p>The most important part of a package is the package.json file. This file 
        describes the settings for your package to seed and other CommonJS-compliant
        package managers.</p>
        <p>At a minimum is must contain the following two properties:</p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>{
     "name": "hello-world",
     "version": "0.1.0"
  }
        </code></pre></blockquote>

        <p>The name must be the name of the package. It should match the name of the 
        directory your package is in (&#8216;hello-world&#8217; in this example). The version
        number must increment anytime you plan to publish new changes. It must 
        follow the <a href="http://semver.org">semantic versioning spec</a>.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above two properties, you will often want your package.json
        to also list any dependencies like so:</p>
         <blockquote><pre><code>{
    "name": "hello-world",
    "version": "0.1.0",

    "dependencies": {
      "markdown": "1.0.0"
    }
  }</code></pre></blockquote>

        <p>The dependencies hash describes all packages that your package requires in 
        order to run. When someone installs your package via seed, all of these
        dependencies will be automatically fetched an installed as well.</p>
        <p>Each item in the hash defines a single package. The value is a required 
        version number. Since seed uses semantic versioning, naming a version number
        here usually means that any version of the package can be used that is 
        semantically compatible. </p>
        <p>In general this means seed will use any version of the package that is equal 
        to or greater than the version named but less then the next major version 
        number. For example, requiring version &#8216;1.2.0&#8217; will get any version >= 1.2.0
        but &lt; 2.0.0.</p>
        <p>If you do not want to use semantic versioning, you can force seed to use an 
        exact version instead by prefixing the version with an &#8216;=&#8217; sign. For example 
        &#8216;=1.2.0&#8217; will <em>only</em> load version 1.2.0 of the package - nothing later. </p>
        <p>You can also use &#8216;~&#8217; to simply load the latest installed version of the 
        package, but that this is not recommended since it can make your code 
        unstable.</p>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Loading Your Own Package</h1>
      <p>If you are writing an app as a package, you will often want to invoke the 
      code from the command line. To do this, you should create a bootstrap file
      in a &#8216;bin&#8217; directory within your package. It should look like this:</p>
      <blockquote><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env seed

require.loader.register(__dirname, '..');
require('hello-world').main();
      </code></pre></blockquote>

      <p>The first line of code in this example tells seed that you want to register the top-level directory as the current package. This will make the package 
      visible to seed even though it is not installed in the system.</p>
      <p>After you have registered your package you can require the package and invoke
      any methods (like main()) in the example here.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Using Nested Packages</h2>
        <p>One added benefit of working inside your own packages is that you can include
        frozen or nested packages that will override any installed versions. To add 
        a nested package, just create a &#8216;packages&#8217; directory and place your packages
        inside of it. Requiring those package names will cause them to be used 
        instead.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, if you have a package already installed and you just want to
        get a copy into your own package to ensure it is always used, you can use the
        <code>freeze</code> command:</p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>$ seed freeze markdown</code></pre></blockquote>

        <p>This will copy the package file into your own packages directory.</p>
        <p>If you want to edit the package, instead you can use the <code>fork</code> command,
        which will look for a repository definition in the package.json and use it:</p>
        <blockquote><pre><code>$ seed fork markdown</code></pre></blockquote>
      </section>

      <h1>Pushing Packages</h1>
      <p>To push a package, you will first need to signup for an account or login in 
      a machine. If you have never pushed before, signup for an account with:</p>
      <blockquote><pre><code>$ seed remote signup</code></pre></blockquote>

      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to limitations in Node, seed will echo your password to the 
      screen as you type.</p>
      <p>If you already have an account, you should login to a new machine:</p>
      <blockquote><pre><code>$ seed remote login</code></pre></blockquote>

      <p>You only need to login or signup once per machine. Once you&#8217;ve done so, you
      can push a package with the <code>push</code> command:</p>
      <blockquote><pre><code>$ seed push ./hello-world</code></pre></blockquote>

      <p>Note that you must pass the path to the package you want to push, not the 
      package name.</p>
      <p>seed will only allow you to push a particular package version once. If you 
      need to make a change and push again, just bump the patch number and push 
      again.</p>
      <p>That&#8217;s all the docs we have for now. More is coming later.</p>
